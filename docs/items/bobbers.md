# Fishing Bobbers

Fishing bobber items can be added to a fishing rod in order to change the appearance of the bobber when cast. Bobber changes are purely cosmetic and don't apply any bonuses or special effects.

## Colored Bobbers

Colored bobbers are crafted with wooden planks, a slimeball, and any dye.

Their appearance is the same as the default bobber design except for the stripe in the middle, which matches the color of the inputted dye.

## Themed Bobbers

Themed bobbers are crafted the same way as with regular colored bobbers, except they take in a crafting material specific to their theme. For example, the Apple Fishing Bobber (first in the image below) requires wooden planks, a slimeball, and an apple. For a list of crafting materials for each themed bobber, see the list below.
